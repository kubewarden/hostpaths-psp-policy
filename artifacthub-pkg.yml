        This policy is a replacement for the Kubernetes Pod Security Policy that
        controls the usage of `hostPath` volumes. The policy inspects both the
        containers and the init containers that are using `hostPath` volumes.
        `allowedHostPaths` is a list of host paths that are allowed to be used by
        hostPath volumes. An empty `allowedHostPaths` list means there is no
        restriction on host paths used. Each entry of `allowedHostPaths` must have:
        a `pathPrefix` field, which allows hostPath volumes to mount a path that
        begins with an allowed prefix, and a `readOnly` field indicating it must be
        mounted read-only.
      tooltip: A list of host paths that are allowed to be used by hostPath volumes.
