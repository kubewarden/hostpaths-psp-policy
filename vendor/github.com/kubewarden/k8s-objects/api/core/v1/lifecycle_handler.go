// LifecycleHandler LifecycleHandler defines a specific action that should be taken in a lifecycle hook. One and only one of the fields, except TCPSocket must be specified.

// swagger:model LifecycleHandler
type LifecycleHandler struct {

	// Exec specifies the action to take.
	Exec *ExecAction `json:"exec,omitempty"`

	// HTTPGet specifies the http request to perform.
	HTTPGet *HTTPGetAction `json:"httpGet,omitempty"`

	// Sleep represents the duration that the container should sleep before being terminated.
	Sleep *SleepAction `json:"sleep,omitempty"`

	// Deprecated. TCPSocket is NOT supported as a LifecycleHandler and kept for the backward compatibility. There are no validation of this field and lifecycle hooks will fail in runtime when tcp handler is specified.
